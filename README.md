# Welcome to Yoink

[https://yoink.now](https://yoink.now/)

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/yoinknow.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Yoink is a next-generation **internet capital markets platform** on **Solana**, where social content becomes tradable. Users can **speculate on viral creators and moments** from platforms like Twitch — with support for more socials (X/Twitter, TikTok, Instagram) coming soon. Built-in on-chain mechanics like **auto-buybacks** and **Early Bird rewards** make Yoink a new breed of social token launchpad. **Yoink it.**

### What is Yoink?

Yoink transforms creator content into tradable assets. Each token on Yoink is linked to a real creator or piece of content, letting traders speculate on virality while creators earn from every trade through **automated fee-sharing**.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Creator-First Platform**: Every token on Yoink is tied to a real creator. When traders buy and sell, creators earn directly from trading fees. Any creator can verify ownership and claim their earnings at any time. Our goal is to build a **sustainable ecosystem** where creators thrive alongside their communities, with fair and healthy trading conditions.

**Buyer Benefits**: Buyers gain from automatic buybacks that create price floors, Early Bird rewards for early supporters, and the potential to profit from viral content speculation. The platform's built-in mechanics protect against downside risk while maximizing upside potential through community-driven trading and creator success.
