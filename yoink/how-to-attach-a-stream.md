Connect a Twitch stream to your token for real-time engagement and live trading activity. Streaming tokens get special visibility and help build stronger communities around your project.

## 🎯 Two Ways to Stream

{% hint style="info" %}
**🔀 Option 1: Fork Existing Twitch Stream** *(During Token Creation)*

**When to choose:** You're already streaming on Twitch and want to connect your existing audience

➡️ **Steps:**
1. Toggle on "Attach a Twitch stream" during coin creation
2. Enter your stream title → becomes your token's main title  
3. Add your Twitch URL (optional) → `https://twitch.tv/yourusername`
4. Click refresh button → auto-loads live stream information
5. Create token → stream integration happens immediately

✅ **Benefits:**
- Real-time thumbnail updates when live
- "LIVE" badge on token page  
- Direct viewer traffic to your stream
- Increased visibility in streaming section

**🎬 Option 2: Start Direct Yoink Stream** *(After Token Creation)*

**When to choose:** You want native Yoink features and full platform control

➡️ **Steps:**
1. Create your token → without attaching external stream
2. Visit your token page → after creation is complete
3. Click "Start Stream" button → appears on your token page
4. Set up streaming → use provided stream key or browser support
5. Go live → directly on Yoink platform

✅ **Benefits:**
- Native Yoink chat integration
- Built-in trading widgets during stream  
- Platform-specific features
- Full streaming control
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**⚠️ Important Decision:** If you attach a Twitch stream during token creation, you **cannot** start a direct Yoink stream later. 

**Choose carefully:**
- **Twitch Option** → Best if you already have an established Twitch audience
- **Direct Option** → Best for new streamers or those wanting Yoink-native features
