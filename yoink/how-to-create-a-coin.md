3. Choose your preferred connection method:
   - **Email** - Simple signup with email verification
   - **Social Login** - Google, Discord, Twitter, or Apple

{% endhint %}

## Optional Features

### Social Links

Attach your social media presence to build trust and community:

- **Website** - Your official website or landing page
- **Twitter/X** - Your Twitter/X profile or project account  
- **Telegram** - Community chat or announcement channel

All social links are optional but help establish credibility with potential buyers.

### First Buy Protection

{% hint style="success" %}
**Recommended for all creators** - Prevents your coin from being immediately sniped by bots or competitors.
{% endhint %}

**Why use First Buy?**
- Prevents sniping by automated trading bots
- Ensures you get the best price as the creator
- Shows commitment to your own project
- Provides initial liquidity for other traders

**How it works:**
1. Toggle on "Be the first buyer?"
2. Select your purchase amount: 0.5, 1, 1.5, or 2 SOL
3. The system automatically calculates token amount and slippage protection
4. Your buy order executes immediately after coin creation

**Cost Breakdown:**
- Base cost: Your selected SOL amount
- Platform fee: 3.45% automatically added
- Slippage protection: 10% buffer for price changes
- Example: 1 SOL purchase = ~1.1345 SOL maximum cost

### Stream Integration

Connect your Twitch stream to create a live streaming coin:

**Stream Title** (Required if attaching stream)
- The title that appears on your coin's page
- Should match or complement your actual stream title

**Stream Link** (Optional)
- Your Twitch channel URL (e.g., `https://twitch.tv/yourusername`)
- Click the refresh button to auto-load stream information
- System automatically detects if you're currently live

**Live Stream Benefits:**
- Real-time thumbnail updates when you're streaming
- "LIVE" badge on your coin page
- Direct link to your stream for traders
- Increased visibility in Yoink's streaming section

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:** If you attach a stream during coin creation, you cannot create a separate stream later. Choose carefully!
{% endhint %}

### Video Showcase

Upload a promotional video instead of connecting a live stream:

**Video Requirements:**
- Maximum file size: 100MB
- Supported formats: MP4, WebM, AVI, MOV
- Automatically uploaded to IPFS for permanent storage
- Drag and drop supported

**Best Practices:**
- Keep videos under 2 minutes for best engagement
- Include clear audio explaining your project
- Show your face to build trust
- Explain what makes your token unique

{% hint style="warning" %}
You cannot attach both a video and a live stream - choose one or the other.
{% endhint %}
