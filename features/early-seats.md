# 🐦 Early Birds

For every token created on the platform, Yoink introduces an **innovative mechanic** that rewards long-term holders and true believers in the asset.  
**Early Birds** reward the first buyers with claimable **SOL bonuses**, based on their entry time into a coin (the moment of their first buy).  
All fees allocated to the **Early Bird Pool** (see [Fees Settings](fees.md)) are proportionally distributed among the remaining valid seats at the time of **graduation**.

## 🎯 How Early Birds Work

### First-Mover Advantage

{% hint style="success" %}
- **First 20 buyers** automatically get Early Bird seats 
- Minimum purchase of **0.01 SOL** required to qualify for Early Bird status
- Your **entry position** is permanently recorded based on when you first buy
- **Equal rewards distribution** - all valid Early Birds share the pool equally at graduation
- **Paper hands penalty** - selling ANY tokens permanently revokes your Early Bird status
{% endhint %}


### Pool Growth Mechanics

{% hint style="info" %}
**📈 Pool Accumulation Process:**
- **Trading volume**: More trades = larger Early Bird pool
- **Fee percentage**: Every trade contributes to Early Bird Pool
- **Growth phases**: Pool grows throughout entire bonding curve progress
- **Final snapshot**: Pool amount locked when curve completes
- **Claiming window**: Rewards become claimable immediately after graduation

## 🛡️ Security & Anti-Gaming Features

### Paper Hands Protection

{% hint style="warning" %}
**💔 Permanent Disqualification System:**
- **Sell detection**: Smart contract monitors ALL token transfers out, if the user sells 1 token
- **No second chances**: Cannot re-qualify through future purchases
