## Early Bird Questions

### What is an Early Bird?

The first 20 unique buyers of any token who receive a permanent status that earns passive income from ALL trading volume - but ONLY if they never sell.

[Complete Early Bird guide →](../traders/early-bird-bonus.md)

Each of the 20 Early Birds earns equally.

### Can I have multiple Early Bird seats?

### What happens if I sell as an Early Bird?

**You lose the seat permanently**:
* ❌ Forfeit status immediately
* ❌ Stop earning rewards
* ❌ Cannot reclaim ever
* ❌ Seat stays empty (not given to someone else)

### How do I know if Early Bird seats are available?

Token pages show "Early Birds: X/20" - if less than 20, seats available!

### Does buying more tokens help as Early Bird?

**For seat**: No, amount doesn't matter for seat

**For position**: Yes, you hold more tokens (value increase)
