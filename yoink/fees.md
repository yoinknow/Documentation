# Fee Structure

Yoink uses a transparent, fair fee system that benefits all participants in the ecosystem: the platform, creators, early supporters, and token holders.

{% hint style="info" %}
### 4% fee on all buy and sell transactions

This single fee is automatically split among multiple parties to create a sustainable, community-driven ecosystem.

**Important:** All fees (except platform fee) are specific to each individual token and support that token's own ecosystem.
{% endhint %}

## Fee Distribution Breakdown

Every transaction on Yoink incurs a **4% fee** that is distributed as follows:

| Recipient | Percentage | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Platform** | 1.0% | Platform operations & $YOINK buyback |
| **Creator** | 0.8% | Token creator earnings *(for this specific token)* |
| **Early Bird Pool** | 1.2% | Rewards for first 20 buyers *(of this token only)* |
| **Treasury** | 1.0% | Automatic buyback mechanism *(for this token only)* |

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Token-Specific Fees

**Creator Fee (0.8%)**, **Early Bird Pool (1.2%)**, and **Treasury (1%)** are all token-specific. 

When you trade Token ABC:
- Creator fee → Goes to Token ABC's creator
- Early Birds → Shared by Token ABC's first 20 buyers
- Treasury → Used to buyback and burn Token ABC

**Only the 1% platform fee is shared across the entire Yoink ecosystem.**

## $YOINK Buyback Flywheel

{% hint style="success" %}
**🔄 Platform Fees Power $YOINK Growth**

**50% of all platform fees are used to buyback $YOINK tokens**, creating constant buying pressure regardless of individual token performance.

**How it works:**
1. Every transaction generates 1% platform fee
2. 0.5% (half) goes directly to $YOINK buyback wallet
3. Buyback wallet purchases $YOINK from market every 24h.
4. Creates perpetual buying pressure for $YOINK token
5. More platform volume = more $YOINK buybacks

**Example:**
- $1M daily platform volume → $10,000 in platform fees → $5,000 buys $YOINK
- $10M daily platform volume → $100,000 in platform fees → $50,000 buys $YOINK

This percentage can increase as the platform establishes stronger backing infrastructure and achieves sustainable profitability.
