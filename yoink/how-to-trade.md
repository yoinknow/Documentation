# 📈 How to Trade

Trading coins on Yoink is simple — but understanding the core mechanics will help you make smarter decisions and maximize your potential returns.

## What Are Coins?

Coins are **SPL tokens** created on **Solana**, each typically tied to a real creator and their community. When you buy a coin, you're essentially betting on its potential — driven by the creator’s content quality, virality, community engagement, and overall market potential.  
Every trade generates fees that reward both the creator and Early Bird holders, while traders aim to earn returns through price movements and market activity.


## The Bonding Curve

When you create a coin on Yoink, it’s deployed under our smart contract, which automatically generates an **AMM (Automated Market Maker)** powered by a **bonding curve**.  
This mechanism ensures that the token **can’t be rugged or have its liquidity pulled**, providing strong protection for traders.  

The bonding curve manages all trading activity for both buyers and sellers through its **on-chain pricing logic**, keeping the token’s market value accurate and transparent.  
As liquidity grows along the curve, you’ll see a **progress bar** on each token — showing its completion from **0% to 100%**.


## What Happens at 100% Progress?

When a token’s progress reaches **100%**, it **graduates** to the **Raydium DEX**. This marks a major milestone because:

* **Liquidity becomes permanently locked** on Raydium  
* **Price discovery** enters a more open and mature market  
* **Trading volume** often increases significantly  
* The **token integrates fully** into the broader **Solana ecosystem**

Graduation is a positive milestone for token holders — it ensures permanent liquidity, greater exposure, and access to a larger trading community.

## Early Bird Rewards

The first 20 buyers of any token become **Early Birds** and receive ongoing benefits:

* **Fee sharing** from all trades on that token
* **Exclusive status** that can't be bought later
* **Passive income** as long as you hold your tokens

Once you sell your tokens, you lose Early Bird status forever.

## Buyback Mechanics

Yoink features an **automatic buyback system** that creates price floors and supports token values:

* **Trading fees accumulate** in a treasury for each token
* **Automatic buybacks** trigger when treasury reaches certain thresholds
* **Bought tokens are burned**, permanently reducing supply
* **Price support** helps protect against major downturns

This mechanism provides downside protection while potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens through supply reduction.

### Slippage Control

**Slippage** is the difference between expected and actual trade prices. You can adjust this based on:

* **Small trades**: 1-3% slippage usually works
* **Large trades**: May need 5-10% slippage  
* **Low liquidity tokens**: Higher slippage required
* **High volume periods**: Lower slippage possible


### Market Cap Understanding

**Market cap** shows the total value of all tokens. This helps you understand:

* **Small market cap**: Higher growth potential, higher risk
* **Large market cap**: More established, typically less volatile
* **Growth trajectory**: Compare with similar creators
