# Fee Structure

Yoink uses a transparent, fair fee system that benefits all participants in the ecosystem: the platform, creators, early supporters, and token holders.

{% hint style="info" %}
### 4% fee on all buy and sell transactions

This single fee is automatically split among multiple parties to create a sustainable, community-driven ecosystem.

**Important:** All fees (except platform fee) are specific to each individual token and support that token's own ecosystem.
{% endhint %}

## Fee Distribution Breakdown

Every transaction on Yoink incurs a **4% fee** that is distributed as follows:

| Recipient | Percentage | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Platform** | 1.0% | Platform operations & $YOINK buyback |
| **Creator** | 0.8% | Token creator earnings *(for this specific token)* |
| **Early Bird Pool** | 1.2% | Rewards for first 20 buyers *(of this token only)* |
| **Treasury** | 1.0% | Automatic buyback mechanism *(for this token only)* |

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Token-Specific Fees

**Creator Fee (0.8%)**, **Early Bird Pool (1.2%)**, and **Treasury (1%)** are all token-specific. 

When you trade Token ABC:
- Creator fee → Goes to Token ABC's creator
- Early Birds → Shared by Token ABC's first 20 buyers
- Treasury → Used to buyback and burn Token ABC

**Only the 1% platform fee is shared across the entire Yoink ecosystem.**

## Understanding Each Fee Component

### 1. Platform Fee (1%) 🏢

**Scope:** Platform-wide (not token-specific)

The 1% platform fee is further split 50-50:

* **0.5%** → Platform Treasury (operations, development, maintenance)
* **0.5%** → $YOINK Buyback Wallet (flywheel mechanism)

{% hint style="success" %}
**💡 Flywheel Effect**

Half of all platform fees automatically buy back $YOINK tokens, creating constant buying pressure and value accrual for $YOINK holders.

### 2. Creator Fee (0.8%) 👤

**Scope:** Token-specific (goes to that token's creator)

* Goes directly to the token creator's wallet
* Same rate as pump.fun (we compensate via user pool)
* Continues even after token graduates to Raydium
* Incentivizes quality token creation and ongoing promotion

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example:** If you trade $DOGE token, the 0.8% creator fee goes to $DOGE's creator, not other token creators.

### 3. Early Bird Pool (1.2%) 🐦

**Scope:** Token-specific (only for that token's early birds)

* Shared among the **first 20 buyers** of each specific token
* Rewards early supporters and risk-takers
* Claimable after holding requirements are met
* Creates incentive for early discovery

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example:** If you're one of the first 20 buyers of $PEPE token, you earn from all future $PEPE trades. Other tokens' trades don't affect your earnings.

### 4. Treasury Pool (1%) 💰

**Scope:** Token-specific (buybacks only that token)

* Funds the automatic buyback mechanism **for that specific token**
* Used to buy and burn tokens when price drops below EMA
* Grows with that token's trading volume
* Creates price support specific to that token

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example:** When you trade $CAT token, the 1% treasury fee builds $CAT's buyback fund. This fund only buys and burns $CAT tokens, not other tokens.

## $YOINK Buyback Flywheel

{% hint style="success" %}
**🔄 Platform Fees Power $YOINK Growth**

**50% of all platform fees are used to buyback $YOINK tokens**, creating constant buying pressure regardless of individual token performance.

**How it works:**
1. Every transaction generates 1% platform fee
2. 0.5% (half) goes directly to $YOINK buyback wallet
3. Buyback wallet purchases $YOINK from market every 24h.
4. Creates perpetual buying pressure for $YOINK token
5. More platform volume = more $YOINK buybacks

**Example:**
- $1M daily platform volume → $10,000 in platform fees → $5,000 buys $YOINK
- $10M daily platform volume → $100,000 in platform fees → $50,000 buys $YOINK

This percentage can increase as the platform establishes stronger backing infrastructure and achieves sustainable profitability.
