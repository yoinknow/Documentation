# ♻️ $YOINK Flywheel

**$YOINK is the beating heart of our virality capital markets platform.**

It's not just a token—it's what we stand for. Every trade, every viral moment, every creator success feeds back into $YOINK. The more the platform grows, the stronger $YOINK becomes.

## 💰 How Platform Fees Power $YOINK

Every transaction on Yoink generates a **4% fee (see fee page)** .\
From that, 1% goes to Yoink Platform.\
Here's where it splits:

| Fee Component        | Percentage | Destination                    |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| Platform Fee         | **1%**     | Split 50-50                    |
| → Platform Treasury  | 0.5%       | Operations & Development       |
| → **$YOINK Buyback** | **0.5%**   | **Buys $YOINK from market** 🔥 |

#### 🔄 The Flywheel in Action

**For every transaction on the platform, 0.5% automatically buys $YOINK.**

* $100K daily volume → $500 buys $YOINK
* $1M daily volume → $5,000 buys $YOINK
* $10M daily volume → $50,000 buys $YOINK

**More platform volume = More $YOINK buybacks = Stronger ecosystem**

#### Token Graduation Treasury

When a token graduates from the bonding curve to Raydium, any **remaining treasury balance** (originally used for that token's buybacks) is also used to **buyback $YOINK**.

This means successful token graduations create additional $YOINK buying pressure beyond the standard platform fees.

## 🚀 The Vision

**$YOINK captures the value of virality itself.**

As Yoink becomes the standard for creator capital markets, $YOINK becomes the ultimate bet on:

* The virality economy
* Creator monetization
* Viral content markets
* Traders get a safer support for trading

This is the flywheel. ♻️
